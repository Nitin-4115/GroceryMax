# 🛒 GroceryMax: A Web-Based Grocery Inventory and Point-of-Sale Management System

## 📘 Description

GroceryMax is a web-based stock management system designed for small to medium-sized grocery or retail stores. It replaces manual inventory tracking with a centralized, database-driven system, improving efficiency and accuracy.

The application provides:

  - Inventory control
  - Point-of-sale (POS) transactions
  - Supplier and customer management
  - Purchase orders
  - Reporting and analytics

Built with Python (Flask) and SQLAlchemy ORM, GroceryMax offers a clean and intuitive interface using Bootstrap, and implements role-based access control for Administrators and Cashiers.

## 🚀 Features

  - **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure login for Admin and Cashier roles with distinct permissions.
  - **Dashboard (Admin)**: Overview of sales analytics, top products, and key statistics.
  - **Product Management (Admin)**: Full CRUD operations for products (price, stock, category, supplier, barcode).
  - **Catalog Management (Admin)**: CRUD operations for categories and suppliers.
  - **Customer Management (Admin)**: CRUD operations for customer records and viewing purchase history.
  - **Point of Sale (POS)**:
      - Add items via search or simulated barcode scan (WebSocket)
      - Cart management and optional customer association
      - Finalize transactions easily
  - **Inventory Control**:
      - Automatic stock decrement on sale
      - Automatic stock increment on purchase order completion
      - Manual adjustments for damaged or lost items
      - Low Stock Report for items below threshold
  - **Purchase Orders (Admin)**: Create, view, and complete purchase orders for restocking.
  - **Reporting (Admin)**: Filterable sales history, low stock items, and export to CSV.
  - **Database Management**: Schema migrations handled with Flask-Migrate and Alembic.

## 📱 Mobile Barcode Scanner

This repository includes a companion **Android App (`barcode_scanner.apk`)**.

This app allows you to use your smartphone's camera as a wireless barcode scanner for the POS system.

  - **How it works:** The Flask application runs a TCP server that bridges to a WebSocket. The Android app connects to this server over your local WiFi and sends barcode data directly to the "New Sale" page in real-time.
  - **Setup:**
    1.  Install the `barcode_scanner.apk` on an Android device.
    2.  Ensure your phone is on the **same WiFi network** as the computer running the Flask server.
    3.  The app will automatically discover the server. Once connected, any barcode you scan will be sent to the POS.
